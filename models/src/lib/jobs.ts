    description: "I started as a full-stack developer for a global company self-ordering system using C# and Angular. In this role, I developed new functionalities, reviewed pull requests, and presented features to managers. During this project, we followed code design patterns and wrote unit tests to ensure full coverage of all code lines. Later, I transitioned to a frontend developer role in an open banking system that utilized various technologies such as React.js, Svelte, Node.js, and Angular. My primary focus was on creating new features for a back-office system and developing projects from scratch to meet the demands of clients who wanted to use modern web features like monorepos, SSR, and achieve high performance."
